# JimKemp.github.io
My portfolio site, where I document my projects and activities.

## about the code
This website is made using bootstrap and the google material design guidelines.
The code is written according to good programming practices, and was an interesting challenge. It's recently been made more mobile-user friendly. You may notice that two accounts are used in the creation of my site. "ArduinoStorm" is also my account, but the website is owned by the JimKemp account I created for this purpose. 

## licensing
The code is licensed under the MIT license, which means you are free to learn from it, use it in your own projects or even sell it, if for some reason you can make a lot of money off my little site (If you can, let me know)
