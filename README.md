# JimKemp.github.io
My portfolio site, where I document my projects and activities.

## about the code
This website is made using bootstrap and the google material design guidelines.
The code is written according to good programming practices, at least until someone changes said practices!

## licensing
The code is licensed under the MIT license, which means you are free to learn from it, use it in your own projects or even sell it, if for some reason you can make a lot of money off my little site (If you can, let me know)
