        <strong>Boy Scouts</strong>
        <p class="timeline">May 2017- Present</p>
        <p>Since joining Medfieldâ€™s Troop 89 I have dedicated much of my time to troop activities including camping, community service and weekly meetings. I have served in several leadership positions including being elected by my peers as a Patrol Leader and currently as Assistant Senior Patrol Leader. I was also appointed by our Scoutmaster to serve as Troop Guide: a mentor for incoming scouts. I am advancing through the ranks and will soon begin work on the requirements for Eagle Scout. I am also in charge of our website, more information is available on the projects page

        <p class="timeline">2015 - Present</p>
        <p>
          One of my greatest passions is for robotics, I have built several completely autonomous robots from scratch, and programmed them in C++ and Python. If you would like to learn about my robots, you can look at them on the projects page.

        <strong>Student Council</strong>
        <p class="timeline">Elected 2017</p>
        <p>
          In sixth grade I was elected to the Student Council where I organized dances, spirit days and fundraisers. One such fundraiser was a volleyball tournament where I worked with a charity who assisted people with mental disabilities and coordinated how our school could donate.

        <strong>School Cross-country team</strong>
        <p class="timeline">Summer 2019 - Present</p>
        <p>
          This summer I gave up dessert, followed my carefully planned exercise program, and practiced every other day from the last day of school to the first day of school because I was on the cross country team and I was determined not to let them down. My training made me a prized runner and knowledgeable teammate, and I brought to cross country my own brand of leadership which drew compliments from all my coaches.

        <strong>Theater Lighting and Sound Team</strong>
        <p class="timeline">2017</p>
        <p>
          In sixth grade I had the opportunity to participate in the middle school theater. I quickly rose to head of lighting, and I made programs to automate the lights so future plays could be easily set up by plugging together a few of my premade and tested lighting combinations.
