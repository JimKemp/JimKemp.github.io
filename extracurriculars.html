        <strong>Boy Scouts</strong>
        <p class="timeline">May 2017- Present</p>
        <p>Since joining Medfieldâ€™s Troop 89 I have dedicated much of my time to troop activities including camping, community service and weekly meetings. I have served in several leadership positions including being elected by my peers as a Patrol Leader and currently as Assistant Senior Patrol Leader. I was also appointed by our Scoutmaster to serve as Troop Guide: a mentor for incoming scouts. Recently, I reached the Life scout rank, the second highest rank in scouting and began work on Eagle. I am also in charge of our website, more information is available on the projects page

        <strong>Robotics</strong>
        <p class="timeline">2015 - Present</p>
        <p>
          One of my greatest passions is for robotics, I have built several completely autonomous robots from scratch, and programmed them in C++ and Python. If you would like to learn about my robots, you can look at them on the projects page. <br> It is a source of great pride to me that I was invited to join the highschool robotics team while only in seventh grade, making me the teams youngest member of all time. That's me on the far left of this photo.<p>

        <strong>Student Council</strong>
        <p class="timeline">Elected 2017</p>
        <p>
          In sixth grade I was elected to the Student Council where I organized dances, spirit days and fundraisers. One such fundraiser was a volleyball tournament where I worked with a charity who assisted people with mental disabilities and coordinated how our school could donate.

        <strong>School Cross-country team</strong>
        <p class="timeline">Summer 2019 - Present</p>
        <p>
          This summer I gave up dessert, followed my carefully planned exercise program, and practiced every other day from the last day of school to the first day of school because I was on the cross country team and I was determined not to let them down. My training made me a prized runner and knowledgeable teammate, and I brought to cross country my own brand of leadership which drew compliments from all my coaches.

        <strong>Theater Lighting and Sound Team</strong>
        <p class="timeline">2017</p>
        <p>
          In sixth grade I had the opportunity to participate in the middle school theater. I quickly rose to head of lighting, and I made programs to automate the lights so future plays could be easily set up by plugging together a few of my premade and tested lighting combinations.
