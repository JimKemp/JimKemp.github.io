          My name is Jim Kemp, and my dream has always been to advance humanity through innovative technology.  <br><br> 1 I'm in college now! Hard to beleive I made this site in the eigth grade and it's been unchanged since 9th grade! Not for much longer, though.

		<strong>The College Update</strong><br>
		It's been a few years and my trusty website needs some improvements. Time for a major overhaul! 

		This feature may take a while:
		- An actual serious project repository. This might be a little more advanced, because I'd like a system where projects can be linked to blog posts and eachother, so one project builds off another <br><br>
		That's all for now folks! More stuff coming soon! Let's hope Lehigh lets me use this site as a "portfolio" rather than borrowing their godwful wordpress template!
