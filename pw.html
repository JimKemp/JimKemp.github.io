            What does 3^2 mean? It means 3 x 3, and it’s called an exponent. Archimedes invented exponents to count very large numbers. He first displayed his exponents in a letter called The Sand-Reckoner, a short explanation of how one could count all the sand in the universe*. This letter was addressed to king Gelon, the king of Sicily.

             Archimedes was born in 287 BCE, in the city of Syracuse, which was a part of Sicily. Archimedes loved his country very much, and although he visited Alexandria, he was friends with king Gelon and invented several war machines such as a giant catapult to protect the city from Romans. He also invented the Archimedes Screw, a device that raises water by turning a crank and, unsurprisingly, looks like a screw. The concept is still used today to propel boats. He created the field of hydrostatics as well, and legend says it was to determine the value of king Gelon’s crown. This discovery supposedly prompted him to go around naked yelling “Eureka!”. In addition to inventing these things, he was also a great mathematician and developed an accurate calculation of pi, calculated the volume of a sphere and found an interesting relationship between spheres and cylinders, which he had immortalized on his grave. The way in which he deduced these things was outlined in his Method Concerning Mechanical Theorems, (which he sent to a philosopher friend of his, Eratosthenes) and they were suspiciously similar to modern calculus. If only Archimedes had invented the concept of limits, his methods would have been the first form of calculus.

               Archimedes was famed for his circles, spheres and cylinders, and is alleged to have written On sphere-making, but no traces of the work exist±. When his war machines could no longer hold the Romans at bay (after a long and interesting fight described in The Life of Marcellus by Plutarch of Chanoria), their general, Marcillus, ordered that Archimedes be captured. Marcellius described Archimedes as a “Geometrical Briarius” (Briareus being a hundred-handed one of Greek mythology, which was at the time also the religion of Rome, until they converted to Christianity. Briareus is mentioned in the Iliad by Homer), and when they eventually sacked the city, the attempted to capture him. However, so engrossed was he in his work that a Roman soldier killed him out of impatience. The tomb of Archimedes was lost for a long time, until it was (supposedly) found by Cicero, a Roman politician, but modern society does not know where it is.

              *(Specifically, he counted how much sand it would take to fill the universe. However, his estimation of the universe’s size was nowhere near correct, as the widely-held belief of the time was that the sun and stars revolved around the earth, and that the universe was merely a circle formed by the orbit of the sun.)

              ±(Historians are fairly sure that he was actually referencing planetariums, and that he built several of these. When the Roman general Marcellus looted the city, he took one back to Rome, but we are not sure where it is now)
